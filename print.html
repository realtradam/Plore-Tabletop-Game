<p>In the world of Plore, the fates of travellers is intertwined. If you wish to survive you will best remember to work together and prop each others capabilities up, lest you shall all perish alone. Create your characters together such that their stories and personalities will tend to work together rather then clash.</p>
<p>Characters consist of 3 core descriptors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Something you know
<ul>
<li>Disciplines</li>
<li>Spells &amp; Abilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Something you are
<ul>
<li>Vices</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Attributes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Something you have
<ul>
<li>Gear</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This page will give you a simple sample character creation example to show step by step how a character is made, while the following pages explain in detail each step of the character creation process.</p>
<h4 id="sample-character-creation"><a class="header" href="#sample-character-creation">Sample Character Creation</a></h4>
<h3 id="disciplines-and-vices"><a class="header" href="#disciplines-and-vices">Disciplines and Vices</a></h3>
<p>First you should select 1 or 2 disciplines your character has undertaken in their life. Disciplines will give you advantages when rolling for checks that could reasonable fall under ypur chosen disciplines. Vices however will do the opposite, they will cause increased difficulty accomplishing checks related to them. Outside of these mechanics your should keep in mind to play ypur chracter in a way that would make sense goven these choices. Characters should be tempting for their characters rather then just avoiding them for the sake of avoiding the disadvantage it imposes.</p>
<h3 id="stat-distribution"><a class="header" href="#stat-distribution">Stat distribution</a></h3>
<p>You have 6 points to spend in each suit of skills for an initial total of 24 points however you like with the following restrictions:</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not allot more then 5 points into a any stat</li>
<li>You may not allot less then 1 point into any stat</li>
</ol>
<p>Once these points are alloted you have 3 more points to spend in any way you see fit such that they still follow the above 2 restrictions resulting in a final total of 27 points.</p>
<!--Once you have a character in mind you can begin building their stats. You have 6 points to spend in each suit of skills to spend however you like. this is a total of 12 points(3 for diamonds, 3 for hearts, etc). Once this is done you have 2 more points you can spend in such a way they the 2 points are not spent on the same suit of skills.-->
<p>Here is an example of a stat distribution. 6 points are assigned to each suit, and then 3 more points are added afterwords to the spades suit.</p>

<h4 id="level-up"><a class="header" href="#level-up">Level Up</a></h4>
<p>Character attributes do not change when characters level up. Instead character gain other benefits on level up.</p>
<!-- #### Sample Level Up -->
<!-- Whenever a character levels up, the player gets 2 points that they can place into any stats. Like when you spent the 2 points on character creation these points must spent on two skills from different suits. -->
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-you-know"><a class="header" href="#what-you-know">What You Know</a></h1>
<p>What your character knows is the most important and defining feature of your character. If you character doesn't know anything then they aren't anyone that matters.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="disciplines"><a class="header" href="#disciplines">Disciplines</a></h1>
<p>A discipline is a career, passion, or hobby your character knows intimately well. When your character is first starting out adventuring then they will posses 1-2 disciplines, usually split between one career and one hobby. These disciplines are key to being able to use your attributes in checks. Whenever you make a check to do some action, if your discipline would give you reasonably give you some kind of expertise in accomplishing this task then the GM will allow you to use a stat of their choosing as a bonus to the action. For example a character with a shopkeeper discipline could gain a practical(spade) attribute bonus towards bartering at a shop. Without a relevant discipline a character will not be able to use attributes as bonuses for regular actions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vices"><a class="header" href="#vices">Vices</a></h1>
<p>Vices are thinks your character is bound and weak to. Deal with the vice to be rewarded, but we weary as if you try to ignore it then it will come back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>When creating a fate deck at the start of a game each player is given a vice card that is shuffled into their deck. This card cannot be discarded by any means except when its respective effect is triggered or when a catharsis token is used. Whenever this card is drawn from the deck its effect is triggered and the player must succumb to their vice in some way that is detrimental to themselves and the party, the intensity determined by the type of card.</p>
<p>This surprise however can be avoided if the player intentionally acts upon the vice or the character copes in some way relating to the vice before this card is drawn. When the player does this then player receives a catharsis token. The next time this character draws a vice card this session they give up the token and in return this makes the vice card count as a wildcard of the respective suit on the card. However if the card is not drawn before the end of a session then the token is discarded. Characters are allowed to carry multiple catharsis tokens and only lose 1 per vice card drawn.</p>

<p>Quality is determined by a resource die. Whenever during an encounter(combat or otherwise) if you receive damage then you roll resource die to determine if it got damaged. Armour is only damaged this way at most once per encounter.</p>
<p>Some armour change traits depending on the 'Quality' resource die.</p>
<p>When an enemy wearing armour is damaged and the damage matches one of the damage types of the armour then the damage is reduced by block value of the armour up to a minimum of 1 damage dealt(unless the enemy is immune). For player characters wearing armour if the damage is equal or less then the block value then the character takes no damage.</p>
<p>You can wear one set of armour and one set of clothing. In general armour must be worn over clothing.</p>

<h2 id="traits"><a class="header" href="#traits">Traits:</a></h2>

<p>Weapons are a special item type which grant character abilities that can be used when the weapon is wielded. Weapons also have various properties which affect your character in combat. Some of these are listed below. When the attack is possible to make, only ranged weapons, improvised weapons, or weapon attacks that specify require a check to see if the attack hits. Otherwise the weapon will automatically hit your target.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fate-deck"><a class="header" href="#fate-deck">Fate Deck</a></h1>
<p>The fate deck is a single playing card deck which is used by all the players of the game to build their respective deck. The cards from this deck are used by players to do actions or abilities of their characters. The players individual decks are rebuilt every once in a while.[TODO: how often?]</p>
<h2 id="building-the-fate-decks"><a class="header" href="#building-the-fate-decks">Building the Fate Decks</a></h2>
<p>The GM separates the face cards from the fate deck(kings, queens, jacks and aces). These face cards are then shuffled and one is dealt out to each player. The remaining numbered cards are then selected according to each players respective character's rules for selecting fate cards. Once selected the remaining numbered cards are shuffled and dealt out evenly among the players. Finally any relevant character abilities for further modifying the player Fate Decks are put into play. Once this is done the player Fate Decks are ready for play.</p>
<p>-- new idea --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whenever the players long rest, reset all cards into a single deck. Each player pick 5 cards from the deck, then distribute the remaining cards randomly. Players have X amount of cards in their hand and draw more whenever it goes below that limit. Players get some kind of punishment/detriment for having an empty deck(this is the in game mechanic representing exaustion)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When players use an action or ability they roll a d10. The resulting roll value can be used in place of a card. The suit of the roll depends on the class of the roller. Some classes can use an extra d4 which they can use the result of the roll to add or subtract any of their cards or rolls once that action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="resolving-checks"><a class="header" href="#resolving-checks">Resolving Checks</a></h1>
<p>When the player attempts to do an action and the GM has determined it is not trivial(e.g failure is possible and not insignificant) the GM should give the player a check which will determine the fate of their action.</p>
<p>Here is an explanation of each step of a check.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-action-request"><a class="header" href="#1-action-request">1. Action Request</a></h3>
<p>Player asks to do an action or ability, naming a relevant discipline and/or object if applicable which would assist them(players are <strong>NOT</strong> to state they are 'using' or 'intending to use' a stat)</p>
<h3 id="2-determine-difficulties-and-advantages"><a class="header" href="#2-determine-difficulties-and-advantages">2. Determine Difficulties and Advantages</a></h3>
<p>GM determines how difficult a check is and what the relevant skill is.
| Medium | Hard | Extreme | Borderline Impossible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3-4 | 5-7 | 8-10 | 11-12 |</p>
<p>Subtract the player's relevant skill from the difficulty. If they are using a relevant skill then subtract 2 more.</p>
<h3 id="3-resolve-the-check"><a class="header" href="#3-resolve-the-check">3. Resolve the Check</a></h3>
<p>The player resolves the check by rolling. If the result is higher or equal to the difficulty then they succeed. Otherwise they fail.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="combat"><a class="header" href="#combat">Combat</a></h1>
<h2 id="bargain"><a class="header" href="#bargain">Bargain</a></h2>
<p>At any point during combat the players and the enemies can bargain with eachother to cease fighting.</p>
<h2 id="start-of-combat"><a class="header" href="#start-of-combat">Start of Combat</a></h2>
<p>GM places enemies on board, draws from environment deck and places them in play as well. GM Rolls to determine which player goes first.</p>
<h2 id="a-round"><a class="header" href="#a-round">A Round</a></h2>
<p>A single round starts from the first player's turn and goes clockwise until all players have gone once. Then the enemy's actions are resolved. Once they are resolved a new round can begin.</p>
<h2 id="a-player-turn"><a class="header" href="#a-player-turn">A Player Turn</a></h2>
<p>Regain all energy and draw a card from the player deck. During their turn players can spend their energy however they would like. Once they end their turn the player must discard down to their max hand size(default 3)</p>
<h2 id="enemy-turn"><a class="header" href="#enemy-turn">Enemy Turn</a></h2>
<p>The GM resolved the enemy effects in any order they wish. Any enemy that was not targeted this round by a player attack deals damage to a player of the GMs choice equal to the enemy's attack stat. Once all of these are resolve then the enemy turn ends.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="social-1"><a class="header" href="#social-1">Social</a></h1>
<p>Social checks take into account 3 different factors in addition to the regular ones.</p>
<h2 id="factors"><a class="header" href="#factors">Factors</a></h2>
<h3 id="difficulty"><a class="header" href="#difficulty">Difficulty</a></h3>
<p>How difficult the given persuasion attempt is.</p>
<h4 id="resilience"><a class="header" href="#resilience">Resilience</a></h4>
<p>How resilient the person you are talking to is to persuasion of the given thing.</p>
<h4 id="reputation"><a class="header" href="#reputation">Reputation</a></h4>
<p>This is how you are viewed in the community. It is determine by the actions you commit toward those in the community. Harassing people increases the negative view while helping people increases the positive view. It is tracked by the GM by using a 4x4 grid where one axis is &quot;good&quot; and the other axis is &quot;evil&quot;. Staying between makes you considered as &quot;chaotic&quot;. Generally not possible to revert the good or evil status, they only increase the more respective actions you do towards the community.</p>
<h3 id="persuasion"><a class="header" href="#persuasion">Persuasion</a></h3>
<p>Your persuasion stat is dependant on some of the following factors.</p>
<h4 id="bargain-chipsfavours"><a class="header" href="#bargain-chipsfavours">Bargain Chips/Favours</a></h4>
<p>Things you learn about characters can be used to your advantage. Not necessarily something negative, could be for example doing a task for someone as a favour.</p>
<h4 id="apparel-presentation-relevant-skill"><a class="header" href="#apparel-presentation-relevant-skill">Apparel, Presentation, Relevant Skill</a></h4>
<p>The way you dress, as well as the race you play also has an effect on how receptive others are toward your social attempts. As a possible example: wearing expensive fancy attire may make you more trustworthy to rich socialites but could make you less convincing to those less fortunate. Wearing armour may make your appear like a &quot;dumb brute&quot; which can incentivize characters to take it off. Some settlements also could be predisposed to trusting or distrusting certain races, factors that affect your odds of success.</p>
<h2 id="resolution"><a class="header" href="#resolution">Resolution</a></h2>
<p>If the difference between difficulty and persuasion is between 1 and 6 then the player must roll to make up the difference. The result of this roll will determine if there is a cost to pay for the success. If the difference is greater then 6 then the persuasion fails. If the difference is 0 or negative then the attempt succeeds.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="travel"><a class="header" href="#travel">Travel</a></h1>
<p>When travelling, each day spent in travel is resolved by the GM drawing event cards that are put in play and need to be resolved before proceeding. If the GM draws an enemy then they draw again until they draw an event. The players must fight the group of enemies and then after the combat they must resolve the event.</p>
