 ## Your Turn

 At the start of your turn you draw one card from deck. You have 3 stamina to spend as you see fit during your turn. Your stamina is restored at the end of each of your turns so it is best to spend it. it costs stamina to move, attack, casts spells, etc. The card you drew from your deck can be applied to any appropriate spell or ability that you wish to use.
