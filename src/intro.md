# Intro

Big rework going to happen. I want to use custom cards instead.

Players race card has 2 abilities:
Tap to play a card
Unique race ability

Players can play 1 free card, and can tap any of their cards for free on their turn or in reaction

Players have blood tokens. These are flipped when the player takes a killing blow or casts spells. Players die when they are all flipped.

## Types of cards:

### Tarot Cards

- These are used as "mana" for abilities and spells. You can choose to draw a card at the start of your turn. You can reshuffle your discard into your deck at the cost of 1 hp.

### Equipment Cards

- These are weapons, armours, and clothing. There is a limit to how many you can wear at once.

### Ability Cards

- Skills that your character has

### Environment Cards

Cover, Equipment, Etc placed in a room that can be used

### Loot Cards

Consumable items such as potions, bombs, etc

## Combat(social/physical) Turns

Random player goes first, alternates between player and npcs. Goes either clockwise or counterclockwise(random)

Players have 3 energy. Cards will show how much energy they cost, if any. You refresh your energy at the end of your turn. You can use items and some abilities as a reaction as long as you have enough energy to do them.

Players and Enemies have 4 combat stats: Health, Attack, Riposte, Dodge
- Heath: How much damage one can take before being out for the fight.
- Attack: How much damage is delivered on a successful roll.
- Reposte: Damage you deal when an opponent misses
- Dodge: Chance of an enemy missing an attack
