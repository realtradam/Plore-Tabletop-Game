# Intro

Money is represented by resource die.
d4 d6 d8 d10 d12 d20
Whenever you spend a night at a tavern, it costs one roll
Whenever you have duplicate dice they get combined into 1 die higher.
E.g d8 and d8 combine to d10
Buying things costs x amount of rolls.
E.g a legendary sword might cost 3d8 to buy. This means u need at least a d8 or higher, you then roll that 3 times. If at least one or more of those rolls is a 1 the die gets downgraded 1 step but no more.

Big rework going to happen. I want to use custom cards instead.

Players race card has 2 abilities:
Tap to play a card
Unique race ability

Players can play 1 free card, and can tap any of their cards for free on their turn or in reaction

Players have blood tokens. These are flipped when the player takes a killing blow or casts spells. Players die when they are all flipped.

Melee attacks subject to a reposte. If you miss your attack the enemy automatically does a reposte if they have one.
When using a ranged weapon, you cannot use it to attack any enemy that attacked and hit you with a melee attack since your last turn.

## Types of cards:

### Tarot Cards

- These are used as "mana" for abilities and spells. You can choose to draw a card at the start of your turn. You can reshuffle your discard into your deck at the cost of 1 hp.

### Equipment Cards

- These are weapons, armours, and clothing. There is a limit to how many you can wear at once.

### Ability Cards

- Skills that your character has

### Environment Cards

Cover, Equipment, Etc placed in a room that can be used

### Loot Cards

Consumable items such as potions, bombs, etc

## Combat(social/physical) Turns

Random player goes first, alternates between player and npcs. Goes either clockwise or counterclockwise(random)

Players have 3 energy. Cards will show how much energy they cost, if any. You refresh your energy at the end of your turn. You can use items and some abilities as a reaction as long as you have enough energy to do them.

Players and Enemies have 4 combat stats: Health, Attack, Riposte, Dodge
- Heath: How much damage one can take before being out for the fight.
- Attack: How much damage is delivered on a successful roll.
- Reposte: Damage you deal when an opponent misses
- Dodge: Chance of an enemy missing an attack
