The world map is divided into regions. Each region will have a randomly assigned tarot card which will determine the type of magic availible from a given plane. 

Each plane wil consist of a variety of "elemental" zones which shift around relative to our own plane.

Spells exist in 4 different "axis"(e.g strength, range, aoe, etc). Each card symbol will affect the spell in those various ways.

We probably want few spells, but each spell individually gives a lot of variety.
