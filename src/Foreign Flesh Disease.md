When a spell heals for more or equal to the targets current health they get this ilness status with a number of tokens equal to the amount healed:

- Whenever you heal: add a number of tokens equal to the amount healed
- Whenever you take an instance of damage: remove one token.
- If the number of tokens is equal to or exceeds your current health: you die and become a fleshy blob mass.
- If the number of tokens is reduced to zero: the illness is cured.
