# Combat
 
## Start of Combat

GM places enemies on board, draws from environment deck and places them in play as well. 

Turn order will be determined by some way in the future(not yet sure)

All enemy turns are interlaced between player turns

All abilities are tapped or "deactivated"

## Player Turn

At the start of the player turn abilities that are applicable are refreshed. Now the player can use their abilities or tap.

## Other Player's or Enemy's Turns

Only tappable abilities are allowed to be used, in reaction to another player or enemy declaring an action.
