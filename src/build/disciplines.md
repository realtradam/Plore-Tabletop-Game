# Disciplines
A discipline is a career, passion, or hobby your character knows intimately well. When your character is first starting out adventuring then they will posses 1-2 disciplines, usually split between one career and one hobby. These disciplines are key to being able to use your attributes in checks. Whenever you make a check to do some action, if your discipline would give you reasonably give you some kind of expertise in accomplishing this task then the GM will allow you to use a stat of their choosing as a bonus to the action. For example a character with a shopkeeper discipline could gain a practical(spade) attribute bonus towards bartering at a shop. Without a relevant discipline a character will not be able to use attributes as bonuses for regular actions.
