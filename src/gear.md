Bags are an item, they dictate the size of your inventory deck. When in combat you dont just select random items and use them, instead you have to draw them from your inventory deck before equiping them. Some items such as a quick draw belt or a sheath will let you reliably draw the item instantly.

Bags have a number of pockets, each pocket being represented by a seperate deck. This means that you can store things in parallel so they are easy to get.
