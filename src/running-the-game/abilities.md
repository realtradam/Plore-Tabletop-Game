# Abilities

Abilities are represented as cards which your character can learn, equip, and/or use. Spells, weapons, and racial feats are just some of the things which are represented as ability cards. Many of these cards follow shorthand for mechanics which are common throught the game. Here they are:

## Symbols

### Tap
![tap_symbol](tap_symbol.png)   
This symbol represents an ability which can be used once before requiring to be recharged. When a card is "tapped" place it sideways to signify this state. Once the card becomes [refreshed](/running-the-game/abilities.md#refresh) place it regularly. Unless otherwise stated, these cards [refresh](/running-the-game/abilities.md#refresh) at the start of your turn, or within a couple of in game seconds. If there is a set of brackets immediatly after the symbol they denotes the restrictions that must be met to use the ability.

These abilities can be used in reactions on other's turns.

### Suit Card Cost

Each of these 4 symbols represent an ability where you must play a matching card to use it. If there is a set of brackets immediatly after the symbol it denotes an additional restrictions the card played must meet. for example if the symbol is a heart followed by the word "even" in brackets then to activate the ability you must play heart card that has an even number to activate the ability.

These abilities **can not** be used in reactions on other's turns unless otherwise stated.

### Any Card Cost

This symbol represents an ability where you can play a card of any suit. Like the previous explanation, a set of brackets afterwards will denote any additional restrictions.

These abilities **can not** be used in reactions on other's turns unless otherwise stated.

### Blood Cost

This symbol represents an ability where you must use a blood spellcasting tool(unless otherwise specified) and pay for the cost to cast the spell.

## Key Words

### Refresh
To refresh a card means to undo its [tapped state](/running-the-game/abilities.md#tap) state into untapped. This means the card can once again be tapped.
