# Abilities

Abilities are represented as cards which your character can learn, equip, and/or use. Spells, weapons, and racial feats are just some of the things which are represented as ability cards. Many of these cards follow shorthand for mechanics which are common throught the game. Here they are:

## Symbols

### Tap
![tap_symbol](tap_symbol.png)   
This symbol represents an ability which can be used once before requiring to be recharged. When a card is "tapped" place it sideways to signify this state. Once the card becomes [refreshed](/running-the-game/abilities.md#refresh) place it regularly. Unless otherwise stated, these cards [refresh](/running-the-game/abilities.md#refresh) at the start of your turn, or within a couple of in game seconds. If there is a set of brackets immediatly after the symbol they denotes the restrictions that must be met to use the ability.

### Reactive

## Key Words

### Refresh
To refresh a card means to undo its [tapped state](/running-the-game/abilities.md#tap) state into untapped. This means the card can once again be tapped.

# Spellcasting

Spells follow the same rules as abilities, but with some additional rules.

## Blood Magic
Blood spells are the most common and accessable type of magic. These are spells that require blood to power them.

#### Modifieds
You compile a spell by mixing base elements with modifieds. The following are possible modifieds:
- Duration
- Range
- Scale
- Area

### Sorcery
To cast a blood spell a "spell casting" medium may be needed. A given spellcasting medium will have a dice associated with it. When casting a spell this dice is rolled. If the result is greater then the blood cost of a spell then you dont pay anything. However if the number rolled is equal to or less then the value then you pay 1 blood. If the spell cost is higher then the dice of your casting medium then the medium is too weak to cast the spell. Using no casting medium is possible, instead of rolling a dice the result is always 1 and you cannot cast spells higher then this cost.

### Alchemy
Alchemy is a form of magic which involves the preparation of various ingredients which form compounds that perform spell effects.

### Scribe

### Necromancy


## Divine Magic
Divine spells use magic that originates from a god. The rules of these spells vary wildly and can depend on various different factors. These are forbidden in most places so if you somehow get access to one, be careful with how you use it.

## Spell Keywords

### Concentration
When you get damaged while concentrating, you need to reroll the blood die. If you fail the roll you pay the cost and your concentration ends.
