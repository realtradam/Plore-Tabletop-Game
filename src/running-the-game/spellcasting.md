# Spellcasting

## Types of Spells

### Blood Spells
Blood spells are the most common and accessable type of magic. These are spells that require blood to power them.

To cast a blood spell a "spell casting" medium may be needed. A given spellcasting medium will have a dice associated with it. When casting a spell this dice is rolled. If the result is greater then the blood cost of a spell then you dont pay anything. However if the number rolled is equal to or less then the value then you pay 1 blood. If the spell cost is higher then the dice of your casting medium then the medium is too weak to cast the spell. Using no casting medium is possible, instead of rolling a dice the result is always 1 and you cannot cast spells higher then this cost.

### Divine Spells
Divine spells use magic that originates from a god. The rules of these spells vary wildly and can depend on various different factors. These are forbidden in most places so if you somehow get access to one, be careful with how you use it.

### Alchemy
Alchemy is a form of magic which involves the preparation of various ingredients which form compounds that perform spell effects.

### Concentration
When you get damaged while concentrating, you need to reroll the blood die. If you fail the roll you pay the cost and your concentration ends.
