# Combat
 
## Start of Combat

Game board does not use tiles, instead uses cards to represent the game world and state.

Turn order will be determined by some way in the future(not yet sure)

All enemy turns are interlaced between player turns

All abilities are tapped or "deactivated"

## Player Turn

At the start of the player turn abilities that are applicable are refreshed. Now the player can use their abilities or tap.

## Other Player's or Enemy's Turns

Only tappable abilities are allowed to be used, in reaction to another player or enemy declaring an action.

Magic always hits but damage is unpredictable(roll for damage)
Physical can sometimes miss(roll for hit) but has consistant damage

A combat game will be structured in a way inspired by binding of issac board game

Player card vs enemy cards.

The location the players are in will determine what doodads are availible (doodads are things like furniture)
