# Resolving Checks
When the player attempts to do an action and the GM has determined it is not trivial(e.g failure is possible and not insignificant) the GM should give the player a check which will determine the fate of their action.

Here is an explanation of each step of a check:

### 1. Action Request
Player asks to do an action or ability, naming a relevant discipline and/or object if applicable which would assist them(players are **NOT** to state they are 'using' or 'intending to use' a stat)

### 2. Determine Difficulties and Advantages
GM determines:
- how difficult a check is
- what the relevant skill(s) is/are.
- If there are any boons or penalties
	- Each boon point is how many times you can reroll one of the dice. Each dice can only have a boon applied to it once.
	- Each penalty point means the player removes their highest roll.
| Medium |  Hard  | Extreme |
|   ---  |  ----  |   ---   |
|  5,6,7 | 8,9,10 |  11,12  |

### 3. Resolve the Check
The player resolves the check by rolling a number of dice equal to the stats of the player chosen by the GM. Choose the highest dice rolled, if it is equal or higher then the difficulty then the check is passed.

# Social
 
Social checks work the same as checks above, however they have extra factors that affect the number of boons and penalties.

## Factors

#### Reputation
This is how you are viewed in the community. It is determine by the actions you commit toward those in the community. Harassing people increases the negative view while helping people increases the positive view. It is tracked by the GM by using a 4x4 grid where one axis is "good" and the other axis is "evil". Staying between makes you considered as "chaotic". Generally not possible to revert the good or evil status, they only increase the more respective actions you do towards the community.

#### Apparel, Presentation
The way you dress, as well as the race you play also has an effect on how receptive others are toward your social attempts. As a possible example: wearing expensive fancy attire may make you more trustworthy to rich socialites but could make you less convincing to those less fortunate. Wearing armour may make your appear like a "dumb brute" which can incentivize characters to take it off. Some settlements also could be predisposed to trusting or distrusting certain races, factors that affect your odds of success.

#### Bargain Chips/Favours
Things you learn about characters can be used to your advantage. Not necessarily something negative, could be for example doing a task for someone as a favour.
